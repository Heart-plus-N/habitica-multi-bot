3. `habitica-quest-queue-notifier` is like the "main" file of this repo. In Go the convention is to use the name of the repo. Executing `go run` will build and run the executable and display all outputs etc. `go build` will build the project and create an executable `habitica-quest-queue-notifier` in the top level directory of the project. Both of these commands will automatically pull all dependencies.
